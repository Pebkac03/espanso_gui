# espanso_gui

Espanso GUI is my attempt at a graphical user interface for the text expander Espanso. The goal is to make something simple enough that it can be used by anyone who is able to use a computer. I am not a professional developer, do not now git well, and my focus is on development. I won't be expanding on the documentation so requesting it as of now is pointless, if you like the project and like to contribute please to so using issues, or fork it and work on it yourself if you want to. I will however not answer pull requests as of now.

It currently only works on Windows and it needs Espanso to be installed since it as of now only displays your current configuration. It does not display packages, only base.yml and any other yml files in the same directory.

To be able to run it and compile it you need the flutter SDK. The easies way to install flutter and use it is through VS Code:
1. Install VS Code, Git, and the Flutter extension for VS Code.
2. Open VS Code and type Flutter in the command palette.
3. Select new project, VS Code will prmopt you to install the Flutter SDK.
4. Choose download SDK, when prompted "which Flutter template" press Esc.
5. Follow the instructions choosing install location and adding it to PATH. The path to the directory can't have any special characters and the directory can't require elevated priviliges. Stick with the default if unsure.
6. Once installed you can either open the directory containing this repo i VS Code and use the "Run debug" button. Or navigate to your the directory in you terminal and use "flutter run" to launch it.
